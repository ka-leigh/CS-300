What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  In these projects, I was solving the problem of sorting, retrieving, and printing course information in the most efficient manner for academic advisors. Project one focused primarily on determining which data structures would perform the best in terms of run-time and memory usage, and establishing pseudocode. Project two was the actual implementation of developing the code based off the firsts projects information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached the problem by learning the characteristics of the different data structures, and evaluating them. Understanding how the different structures manage data helped me to figure out which option was most effective for the project. Data structures are imiportant becuase they determine how efficiently information can be stored, searched, accessed, and changed, which affects the program's overall performance. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I think one the problem I repeatedly encountered throughout this course was loading the data from the provided files. Making sure the program could load and read the data is a very important step. I overcame this challenge by adjusting the way the file was saved (saving as UTF-8, etc) and then hardcoding the path directly into my code. I know this is not necessarily industry best standard, but it worked for the issue I was running into. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  These projects expanded my approach to software development by reinforcing the importance of planning before actual execution of writing code. Creating pseudocode allowed me the opportunity to develop a "rough draft" of the program, help me organize my code logic, and decide which data structures would work best. Instead of diving straight in to writing code with no clear plan, I could think about it and draft it to help me in my final code. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  This project helped me improve my code organization and commenting, which will make my future programs be easier to understand and maintain. Using pseduocode as a rough draft helped me plan the logic in a better more effective way. I also realized how important naming can be, as there were areas similar things were being referenced in this project. I was also reminded again of how important commenting can be to anyone else who could be assisting with the project, but also just for myself, so I would know what is going on when I hop back in after being away for a day or two.
